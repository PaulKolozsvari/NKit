	-	Difference between "dotnet build" and "dotnet publish":
		-	dotnet build: only builds the project files but does not include any referenced packages.
		-	dotnet publish: builds the project files and includes all of the references packages in the output publish folder.
		-	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52336878/dotnet-build-vs-publish-on-azure-devops

	-	Publish app (not self containted i.e. .NET Core will need to be preinstalled on the target machine where the app is installed on):
		-	dotnet publish -c Release
	
	-	Publish self-contained app i.e. with all the .NET Core dependencies etc so you don't have to install .NET on the target machine.
		-	dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained

	-	Register the Windows Service (from the publlish folder where the app was published):
		-	sc create MyApplicationWindowsService binPath= myapplication.exe

	-	Start the Windows Service:
		-	sc start MyApplicationWindowsService

	-	Stop the Windows Service:
		-	sc stop MyApplicationWindowsService

    -   Uninstall the Windows Service:
        -   sc delete MyApplicationWindowsService
